# Automatic Fan Control System

## Description
This Arduino project utilizes a temperature sensor, servo motor, and DHT library to automatically control a fan based on the ambient temperature. The system continuously monitors the temperature using the DHT sensor and adjusts the fan speed using the servo motor to maintain a comfortable temperature range.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno or compatible board
- DHT (Digital Humidity and Temperature) sensor
- Servo motor
- Fan
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Installation
1. Connect the DHT sensor and servo motor to the Arduino board following the circuit diagram provided in the 'Circuit Diagram' folder.
2. Download and install the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/
3. download or clone the fine and upload to the board
